## Proof of Concept Rootkit README

### Overview
This Python script demonstrates a basic rootkit by hooking into system calls.

## Graph Representation

Here is a visual representation of the rootkit functionalities:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    import_ctypes_logging-->store_original_function;
    store_original_function-->define_hooked_function;
    define_hooked_function-->override_original_function;
    override_original_function-->test_function_call;
    test_function_call-->hooked_function_execution;
    hooked_function_execution-->log_hooked_openprocess;
    log_hooked_openprocess-->execute_malicious_code;
    execute_malicious_code-->log_original_openprocess;
    log_original_openprocess-->resume_script_execution;

```

### Note
This proof of concept showcases basic functionalities and doesnâ€™t cover all security aspects. Use responsibly and understand the risks associated with rootkits.
